# grammar-nasty
Pokes around the twitter firehose stream for usage of their, there, they're, your, you're and similars. Currently only has training mode. Plan to build an auto-tweeter into it (one day). 

## Demo

-Demo: [grammar.meteor.com](http://grammar.meteor.com)-
Demo site doesn't work (and I should sleep instead of fixing it), probably can't install "pos" tagger npm package on galaxy.

Clone/fork and run locally simply with meteor.
